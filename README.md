# KnightCodeCompiler_MJR

This project creates a compiler for a basic programming language called KnightCode. KnightCode supports two data types: STRING and INTEGER and is capable of performing basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), printing out information to the command line, reading input from a user. It also supports conditional if else statements and while loops. 

This projects utilizes two libraries that will need to be installed before running:
    
    ANTLR: antlr-4.13.1-complete.jar
    ASM Bytecode Library: asm-9.6.jar

This project uses a grammar file titled KnightCode.g4 which is used by ANTLR to generate a lexer, parser, and a BaseVisitor which contains methods that are overriden in the MyBaseListener.java class in order to generate bytecode when a node of the parse tree generated by a KnightCode program is visited. 

In order to run, you must first build the grammar and to do so, run the following commands from the command line:

    ant build-grammar
    ant compile-grammar
    ant compile

These commands generate the lexer, parser, etc. using ANTLR, compiles the files in the newly created lexparse directory, and then compiles the java files in the compiler directory.

After completing this, to compile a KnightCode program you will need to run the kcc.java class file from the command line with two arguments, the first being the path to the .kc file you wish to compile and the second being the path to the location you want the output to be outputted to. 

For example, to compile program1.kc (in the tests directory), and output it as program1 to the output directory, you would run the following command:

    java compiler/kcc tests/program1.kc output/program1

Then to run this outputted .class file, you can run:

    java output/program1
